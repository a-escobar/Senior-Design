# Senior Design
The inspiration behind the project was Alejandra’s family business. Her  family lives and works in Juticalpa, in the mostly rural state of Olancho, in the country of Honduras. They own a gas station convenience store called La Eso, which sells high quality fast food as well as other products.  When totaling all products La Eso has in stock, it sums up to over 200. Alejandra’s mother, Margarita Santos,  approached her with a problem she was having when ordering products.  Due to the CoVid-19 Pandemic, many products were in scarcity. Some vendors would have a big stock one day, and then be out for months on end, since they sell to many stores nationwide. When ordering, the person in charge didn’t order enough of very important items, so they would often have to buy them at higher prices - if they could be found at all. Most of these products weren’t as easy to count as a bag of chips or a bottle of soda. Therefore, a new, more number-based approach had to come up.  One that could alert someone when a product in the warehouse was going to run low.  
 La Eso currently uses the software Microsoft Dynamic to keep track of inventory, sales, and basic reports. For this project, we will be researching the properties that Microsoft Dynamic offers to find improvements, and then create a new database management system for restaurants and convenience stores to keep track of inventory and stock.

## Project Description
This database management system is reaching out to our small business owners to keep track of their inventory and stock.    
One of the inconveniences that we would like to address is keeping track of items that are sold differently that they are stocked.  An example of this would be stocking twenty chickens and then selling ten wings, four breasts, and two thighs.  The project will also have a database that saves all data and can give you reports in different formats.  Ideally, you will be able to see graphs, trends, most sold items, items that should be taken out of sale, and anything else that may be necessary to keep track of sales.  The program will also use this data to send out notifications when you need to order more of a product. We have many more ideas going, but these are the ones that we are mainly gearing our focus towards.  
We’d like to start off working on this product in app style for either Android or iOS.  In the future we may also potentially decide to add in an option to run it in a web browser or a computer program as well.  

## Inventory Analysis Application


Our project is to create an app the creates an inventory of a small buisness that will analyis the amount of items left in stock that we get from recipts. The client we have 
uses some older software and would like notifications when the stock is needed to get replaced or added to.

## What our client wants

Biggest problems that they are currently facing:
* The person in charge of ordering doesn’t have any type of notification system, so they often forget when it is time to order
 * If that person is sick, the person who fills in for them doesn’t know what to do (No online records)
  * Make it easier to switch shifts/jobs with someone
* There are a lot of different providers for different products and they all come on different dates
* There is nothing that visually analyzes sales (its all memory)
  * So, if the person with that knowledge isn’t there, there is no way to know
* Counting boxes in the storage facility by hand
  * Numbers often don’t match
* Has one big inventory for storage facility and store
  * Make it two separate inventories
* Hard to keep track of ingredients (items with no barcode)
  * Buying mayo vs. selling a sandwich

# Our wishlist 
1. create an app on both the Mac app store and Android
2. Use photo recognization to analyis the recipts to automatically add it into the inventory list
3. Make it adaptable to not just our client but other small buisnesses
4. AI??????
